Smart robot car code  Use Guide
Please read below information before you use the Smart robot car.

1,Smart robot car comprehensive_Experiment

1) comprehensive_Experiment code file

--This code file includes 2 modes, which are remote control experiment and bluetooth control experiment. Each mode could control the robot car, and realize the ultrasonic obstacle avoidance experiment, infrared ray circuit experiment and infrared ray follow experiment.

Remote control experiment is the default mode, robot is controled by remote. It could changed to bluetooth control mode by clicking the KEY 1 button on the chassis. It could connected with your smart device, then open the App and click bluebooth search, there will be downward arrow on the right side of the search, which is the ID of bluetooth device, you could choose to connect and then start to control the robot car.

2£©Other fils are the library files that the code requires
